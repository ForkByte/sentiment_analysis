# Sentiment Analysis and Filler Word Removal

This repository contains a Python script that performs two natural language processing (NLP) tasks:

1. **Filler Word Removal**: Removes filler words (stop words) from a sentence.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of text from a URL using the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.

## Dependencies

- nltk
- urllib

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following commands:
pip install nltk

## Usage

Run the script `sentiment_analysis.py` to perform both filler word removal and sentiment analysis.

- The script contains an example sentence where filler words are removed.
- The script also analyzes the sentiment of text from a specified URL.

The sentiment scores for the text and the filtered sentence will be printed to the console.
